Interface Architectures (MVC)

History
	1978-79 Learning Research Group @ Xerox PARC
	Set of notes on DynaBook Requirements


Purpose
	Design principles
		Low Coupling; High Cohesion
		Separation of Domain Logic from Presentation
 	BOCTAOE

Compare
	Autonomous View
		Combines state, logic and presentation in one place
		Difficult to test

	Presentation-Abstraction-Control, or PAC

What
	Architecture
		Fancy word for design
		Architecture is about the important stuff
		reducing irreversibility
		Coupling versus Cohesion
			Figuring out if two people are married is easy.
			Figuring out if they should be is hard.
			-- Richard Dalton

	Model
		Domain Model

	View
	Controller
		Front Controller
		Page Controller

Service to Worker
Dispatcher View

Why
	Benefits
		Compartmentalization
			Presentation code requires different skills and knowledge to domain code.

		Maintainability
			Presentation logic and domain logic are easier to understand when separate.

		Testability
			User interfaces and Persistence(DB) are hard to test, separation keeps more logic in more testable places.

		Extensibility
			You can support multiple presentations without duplicating code.
			You can easily add a programmatic API for scripting or exposed as services (E.g. Service Layer as presentation).



	Drawbacks & Limitations
		Complexity of implementation (mitigated by using frameworks)
		Coupling between View and Controller (Command Pattern)





How (Web)
	Model
		View Model | Presentation Model
		Service Model
		Mapping versus Wrapping

	Routing
		Dispatcher

	Data Binding | Model Binding
		Analogous to $form_state['values']
		Static versus Dynamic types

	Controller
		Page Controller
		Front Controller

	View
		Templated View
		Composite View
