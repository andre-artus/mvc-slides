## Route Mapping

### By Configuration:
  * Mapping in external configuration files e.g. XML (Struts), YAML (Symfony 1), and the like
  * Mapping by building a route table in code. E.g. "$routeProvider" in AngularJS
  * Mapping by using metadata. E.g. "@RequestMapping" in Spring MVC or "@Route" in Symfony
