###  Components: Model
* The Model represents information about the Domain. It contains the data and behaviour that make up the core function of the application.
* The Model may also be responsible for handling validation, persistence, and authorization -- often through helper classes.
* The Model does not concern itself with presentation at all: whether rendering, formatting, localization, or other.
